Signup/Login System using Swing {Java}

A simple Signup/Login application build using the Swing framework in Java. The application contains a Signup Page where new users can register themselves, a Login Page where existing users can log into their account and a Welcome Page that greets the user after a successful login into their respective account.
The following steps are to be taken after forking(cloning) the project :
1. Install and setup a MySQL application service(preferably MySQL Workbench)
2. Download and extract the connector.jar file from "https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/" and add it to your project structure.
3. Create your server, then a database and then the table that'll contain the userId's and passwords of the registerd users.
4. Go to the files LoginPage.java, SignupPage.java and WelcomePage.java and make the required changes such as inserting the path to your logo image file, database name, table name, etc.
5. After completing the first 4 steps your application is ready to go. Run the LoginLanding.java file.

Enjoy ! Great Success ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
